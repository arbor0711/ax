testimonial: I am deeply moved by the incredible work that Mr Shirazi has done as our volunteer web designer and developer at Mehr Afarin. It is heartwarming to see how much he care about the children and mothers we serve as he have worked tirelessly to ensure that our website effectively communicates our mission. Thanks to Mr Shirazi's amazing efforts our online presence has become a powerful tool for spreading awareness and rallying support. Mr Shirazi is an invaluable team member and we feel truly blessed to have him with us.
